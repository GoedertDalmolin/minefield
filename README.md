## ℹ️ About this repository
Minesweeper-style mobile game for Windows 7.

This repository's main objective is to demonstrate the application developed to train my knowledge during the Flutter course from the company [COD3R](https://www.udemy.com/course/curso-flutter/).

## ⚙️ Features
This app has the following in-game features:

- Mark fields with flags if there are possible bombs (by pressing and holding a certain field).
- Open a specific field (with a single tap).
- Check how many bombs you have in an open field.
- Open several neighboring fields that do not contain bombs.
- Display whether the player won or lost the game with the emoji displayed in the top-center of the screen.
